#DATASET:

#METHODS TO RUN:
- Exposure distribution across age, country, ect (graphs)
- Primary inference, is it assoc w heart rate, BMI, gender, etc
- Threshhold anaysis (non linear effect around 400mg)
- Mediation pathway (sleep quality mediate caffeine - health assoc)

first we do a welch t test to explore if the 400 mg threshold of caffeine influences heart rate (maybe do two sample, if result is better or paper too long cut one)
then we do regression to see how the other covariables are related to caffeine consumption
